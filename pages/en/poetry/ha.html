<h4>HA</h4>
<p>

    birds sing</br>
    no one summons them</br>
    neither saint nor singer.</br>
    the water is tormented</br>
    the mirror shattered</br>
    while tininess weaves short crumbly sentences</br>
    all the livelong day.</br>
    plaster falls</br>
    grass grows</br>
    closeness grows firm</br>
    how am i to listen to those letters</br>
    to call out ha</br>
    to chase them away</br>
    to sing elsewhere</br>
    as they used to sing</br>
    to one soul that was</br>
    perfect.
