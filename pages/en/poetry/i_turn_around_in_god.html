<h4>I TURN AROUND IN GOD</h4>
<p>i sit in god amid god's</br>
    devices. at god's table surrounded</br>
    by his machines. voices and noises</br>
    of the indistinct angels. in god's</br>
    belly with god's purpose. all that is</br>
    unutterable is unconquerable and is not maintained</br>
    in the fraudulent mirror. a little piece</br>
    of god's soul in me wriggles</br>
    restlessly in god's spaces</br>
    among god's images</br>
    before god's love</br>
    before god's sins.</br>
    i think of god's arson</br>
    of god's anarchy</br>
    of god's fury. god's brothers</br>
    gods hostages i see in death</br>
    in god's justice death reaches them</br>
    god's atrocity</br>
    and god's crime is on their burned</br>
    faces. i turn in god's conversation</br>
    in god's straining</br>
    in god's fear</br>
    that i don't remain alone by god</br>
    in his grandeur</br>
    in his endlessness.</br>
    gods crucifixion utters god's words</br>
    saves its head</br>
    saves god's purity</br>
    supports god's lostness</br>
    crowns god's sorrow.</br>
    i turn in god</br>
    to see where god's heads are flying from</br>
    where nothing advances from</br>
    and i can't see the end of it.
