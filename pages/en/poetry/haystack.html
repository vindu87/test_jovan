<h4>HAYSTACK</h4>
<p>i’ve forgotten the noises of the treetops</br>
    which the voice of the silvery owl broke through</br>
    the attic in which she wove her other life</br>
    the prattle that threw me over the unnamed groves</br>
    the muteness where i would meet my heart as it dissolves</br>
    before the breaths of promises</br>
    i forgot the voices that arrived through</br>
    the gestures of night that in its wings</br>
    hides the kind-voiced beat of tiny creatures</br>
    whose eyes flash like tomorrow that will light up</br>
    the mouth that with substance renews being</br>
    i forgot the slippery canals along whose slopes</br>
    the grass blazed and in whose stomach purpose was transformed into law</br>
    while law into measure which my look could not multiply</br>
    i was a flier of whom it’s not known whether he’s a hunter in a blind or</br>
    a dedicator</br>
    i was in an angelic trumpet in which the air was peaceful</br>
    then i didn’t know that fire was starting to burn in nearby</br>
    and that its glow is the reflection of unchangingness</br>
    and that the haystack burns only in order to calm us</br>
    and that the arsonist is innocent while the measure is dispassionate</br>
    like an event that must take place</br>
    and that every arrangement is outside intelligence</br>
    however much water you’ll spill is already calculated</br>
    and every time when you snatch it closer to the hearth</br>
    your hand will not untangle that like a soul that waits for a blind angel</br>
    to teach it that doing is a fire that does not calm down</br>
    and that blindness is sight that casts far away</br>
    large ears and a babbling mouth</br>
    that blaze like incombustible straw
