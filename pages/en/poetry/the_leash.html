<h4>THE LEASH</h4>
<p>
    along the street that was flooded with twilight</br>
    between the yards where willful knowledge sang</br>
    and the dulled fields through which the raven cawed</br>
    a tiny dog is pulled on a tight chain.</br>
    the boy who pulled him looked like the blind future</br>
    with sharp eyes like judgment in his heart he was making a decision</br>
    while his head was unwrapped like the horizon</br>
    absent like what would fool him</br>
    light like the light that is only acknowledged once</br>
    he was leading the dog down the slopes of darkness</br>
    of the one who in the dark growls and can't bear it.</br>
    but the reason was above both of them</br>
    he who had carried out petty crimes</br>
    and he who held the leash</br>
    to neither of them</br>
    is a measure given</br>
    not one controlled with barking at the unfamiliar</br>
    not one didn't breathe from the motives he recalled</br>
    and no one knew what was in their embryo.</br>
    the dark reason was evening out scores</br>
    what's going to happen will happen in faith</br>
    that he perished outside of knowledge</br>
    that the path of death is the path of a devilish birth</br>
    and that the path of love opens through staggering.
