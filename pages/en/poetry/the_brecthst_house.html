<h4>BRECHT'S HOUSES</h4>
<p>
    <i>for Robert Wein</i></br>
    rain's falling in berlin and i go under the overarches</br>
    to fly over the rooftops and go down under the earth</br>
    to see a living dead man who lies beside his darling.</br>
    he was a hell of a learner</br>
    he waned to know more than a tyrant and less than a stone</br>
    he wanted to get away from insidious blows</br>
    and to find himself with weak friends</br>
    they had thin robes through which winter stung</br>
    through which the cold rain poured</br>
    and here i am in Berlin in his nest.</br>
    the water goes down my cheeks</br>
    while i climb there where the worlds were or their other sides</br>
    speed or sleepiness</br>
    a multitude that needed to save the whole.</br>
    i climb up the stairs in order to</br>
    look over the room for conversations</br>
    to sniff the deathbed</br>
    to marvel over the vessels of illusions</br>
    a smal terrace and a great many cups</br>
    bowls with a dull gleam</br>
    spoons with which food was picked up</br>
    between sentences that like flocks</br>
    settled in the doorways</br>
    in the treetops of the garden that</br>
    gleams like cemetery evergreens in the wilderness.</br>
    and somewhat farther the cemetery paths</br>
    and the dead laid out as if at a market</br>
    behind my back huguenots and opposite bert</br>
    with a great big head</br>
    stately notables</br>
    plaques with names</br>
    stones planted carelessly</br>
    who could have gathered them here besides death</br>
    cold wisdom from which we learn that no one will</br>
    speak up about what has to be kept silent.
