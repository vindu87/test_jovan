<h4>THE TOMCAT</h4>
<p>
    <i>For Svea Haske and Maksi</i></br></br>
    when i got to Berlin</br>
    i ran into a tomcat who met me</br>
    at the door</br>
    he looked at me like a teacher eying an ignoramus.</br>
    his protectress told me he was fatally ill</br>
    and no longer went out in the garden and didn't lie down in the gleaming grass.</br>
    he looked me over as if I was</br>
    someone from far away who would carry his chains.</br>
    but he quickly realized that i was his brother</br>
    that my panting was similar to his</br>
    and that my breathing was like crying.</br>
    he lay in a corner staring into the distance</br>
    as if he was examining what waited for him there.</br>
    berlin is spacious and leans on the water like a prairie</br>
    maybe it will meet me once more like a fish</br>
    mute to tell me anything about its past life</br>
    but prepared to lend its muteness to any schoolchild.
