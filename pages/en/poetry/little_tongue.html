<h4>LITTLE TONGUE</h4>
<p>

    what blooms at the crack of dawn</br>
    what will fade at twilight</br>
    that will be found out in cheery primers.</br>
    o voiceless teachers of life</br>
    abecedaries from which we spell out all that will come to pass.</br>
    scents of earth. grammar lessons. human joy</br>
    that you count yourself out with obituary notices. from what kind of bowl</br>
    to pick up a language that strikes disturbance. who shall open</br>
    the frozen purse behind whose barriers the face of the undead</br>
    creator sneers amusedly. population with uncounted adjectives</br>
    you who swoosh through nontransparent names. shaking up. periods of calm.</br>
    sunstroke that like timidity creeps through dark</br>
    corners. storm winds from the north. growths in front</br>
    of residences: our hope disappears with nature. agreements.</br>
    fatal gestures. faith that overcomes the elements. here</br>
    thus flickers a little tongue that obeys the wisdoms</br>
    of the general god. here where everything should be subject</br>
    to great change. shall it be hard for the seeker to grasp</br>
    those crafty transformations. shall he know</br>
    though the wind scatters the impressions left by a slippery being</br>
    that the one who speaks</br>
    no matter how he strains his neck tendons</br>
    learns to speak most truly</br>
    only when the blade with which</br>
    they cropped his tongue disappears.
