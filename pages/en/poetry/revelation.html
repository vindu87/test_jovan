<h4>REVELATION</h4>
<p>the concentration camps did not exist.</br>
    no executioner existed. nor torturer.</br>
    our wounds are fake.</br>
    the screams unreal. no one ever called on heaven</br>
    no one ever left on a path of no return.</br>
    sisters</br>
    mothers</br>
    are false relations.</br>
    our suffering’s a semblance. memory’s superfluous.</br>
    along the scaffolds are characters from stories</br>
    the questions are primordial superstitions</br>
    everywhere there are but phantoms of changes</br>
    that did not take place</br>
    and events that will not begin.</br>
    there’s no murderer. nor prosecutor</br>
    nor exchange between life and death</br>
    nor angel nor his dark brother</br>
    nor father nor son</br>
    nor sisterly shroud beneath the fortress walls</br>
    nor prayers under an oak nor weeping on the water</br>
    nor death rattle on stone.</br>
    nor darkness in the mud.</br>
    there are neither hostages nor witnesses</br>
    nor child crucified in nightmarish desolation</br>
    water doesn’t flow nor does the sun shine</br>
    no word exists that will loose us from death</br>
    nor convert who recalls revelation</br>
    nor exile who curses at exile.</br>
    o angel of silence</br>
    o heir of measures</br>
    if nothing existed if nothing happened</br>
    why does your heart engrave the blade of nothing</br>
    why do you turn to tail the phantoms of eternity</br>
    and whom will you thank that you are still alive.</p>
