<h4>IRON JAWS</h4>
<p>what are our cites like</br>
    what villages.</br>
    house next to house</br>
    unpredictable paths roads</br>
    vehicles legion</br>
    uncountable sounds.</br>
    each habit is a custom</br>
    and the custom cause for sobbing</br>
    and when they carry or see off a dying man</br>
    and when the police gather in swarms in broad daylight</br>
    and when the dark mass of descriptions is neatly laid aside in waterproof bags.</br>
    how much of it there is no one knows</br>
    while the former knowledge was more dependable after all</br>
    the signature of commissars or of a senior official</br>
    a chance that guarantees wisdom that is not forgotten</br>
    he’s caught even today from a flyer throwing the most wanted</br>
    people without names</br>
    women without passion</br>
    doormen without the familiar diligence.</br>
    bones are sniffed and artificial hips</br>
    photograph their arms and iron jaws</br>
    and send them forward without big words.</br>
    and you go down the street on every balcony a handful of prophets</br>
    some of them clamber up on a wooden chest just to stand over us</br>
    to put the truth on our heads from above</br>
    wherever you turn everywhere are promises</br>
    from the screen they shout that it’s the day of decision</br>
    that it’s the moment not to miss</br>
    and that they’ve found the lookout from which to see the farthest.</br>
    if you stand you don’t know how long it will last</br>
    if you sit you’ll miss your bus</br>
    if you start thinking you’ll forget where you set out to go.
