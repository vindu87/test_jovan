<h4>IN THE DUSK</h4>
<p>In the dusk before the scythe</br>
    they found a warren of rabbits</br>
    they brought a young one that trembled</br>
    i was a boy when i pressed it to my chest</br>
    i shivered like a heart that wanted</br>
    to become a fire that pours out mercy.</br>
    in my hands time scatters</br>
    blood burst out of his nostrils</br>
    love mixes up with death</br>
    and his breath went out.</br>
    i was the scythe that doesn’t stop in its swing</br>
    that falls as if it hasn’t bought even a moment</br>
    and squeezes breathing into a death rattle.</p>
