<h4>AS I AM INFORMED</h4>
<p>

    i let you go, little letter,</br>
    to wander all over without me.</br>
    it couldn’t have been otherwise:</br>
    acceptability testifies to</br>
    acceptability</br>
    that is your land and let</br>
    a chirp spread over it or</br>
    screeching</br>
    as it prefers. and someone who will</br>
    shove their nose between the lines</br>
    will see all kinds of things. here most likely there’ll</br>
    be salt</br>
    but not the kind i used to throw</br>
    before the sparrow or somewhere else.</br>
    they don’t listen to tales of that kind any more</br>
    as i am informed.
