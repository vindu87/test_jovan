<h4>OH SAD SACK SONNY</h4>
<p>

    iâ€™d like to sing.</br>
    to sing out at full voice.</br>
    but when i think</br>
    how much gloom is in the previous</br>
    songs</br>
    how much pain in the refrains</br>
    unhappiness in the calls</br>
    my brethren are inexpert in that art</br>
    clarity will disperse our power</br>
    and then sad sack sonny</br>
    what use will that be to</br>
    a homeland.
