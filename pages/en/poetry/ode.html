<p>
    why i mention joy</br>
    why i summon hope</br>
    why the letter</br>
    why the clarity</br>
    the black angel</br>
    the homeland. is there a cause for it</br>
    is it initiated from somewhere</br>
    that consequence that accumulates</br>
    one after another and rolls this way that way.</br>
    or did the devil teach</br>
    this head to start singing</br>
    and keep on until</br>
    it falls mute.
