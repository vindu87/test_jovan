<h4>WINTER REPORT</h4>
<p>
    everything finally could have been</br>
    different and everything didn’t have</br>
    to happen this way. but every</br>
    outcome is an occurrence</br>
    while acceptance and rejection</br>
    are two gloves before which</br>
    we wriggle. maybe if i were nimbler,</br>
    if i’d risen quicker from the table</br>
    if i’d done that before the tropical</br>
    rains or if i’d lit the fire</br>
    could i have burnt the scattered questions.</br>
    but the outcome’s not pronounced</br>
    the dark is not described.</br>
    i’ll come out into bad weather</br>
    to trample a path</br>
    and i’ll carry the knowledge</br>
    on my shoes.
