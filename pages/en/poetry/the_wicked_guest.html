<h4>THE WICKED GUEST</h4>
<p>
    here’s how i was born</br>
    it’s a long story. in a manger. in a drying barn</br>
    between the pigs’ tails. in a cornfield</br>
    where the idle magpie rummaged and the field mouse</br>
    peered fearfully in case an owl appeared. about wisdom</br>
    everything had been written already and as if i had come into a known</br>
    life. mother hid me: a little monster that screeched</br>
    and toothlessly sought the whole kingdom. father renounced me.</br>
    from there the tales of sinlessness. legends of flight</br>
    were spun while i in truth don’t know whether it happened. later</br>
    i pushed my way through schools. among the knowers who</br>
    would wave the switch and tap their feet while they sang</br>
    songs of the only god. i fixed in memory how they shared out</br>
    and how the dishes were filled: from greater to lesser, never otherwise.</br>
    how it is gathered</br>
    and decanted and i sensed how the worm attacking an apple opens</br>
    secret schools and seduces its pupils. the wine and all the rest arrived</br>
    later. and the wanderings. and the sea. and water. and feasts at which</br>
    it was as if my mouth was gagged. why some would look at me strangely.</br>
    did they want me to be a foreman or a destroyer. a singer of songs</br>
    or a wicked guest who makes an uproar.</br>
    i stumbled while i waited for remission</br>
    to whine in one life</br>
    or to forgive in two.
