<h4>THE ISLAND</h4>
<p>
    the war never ended. i remember the dawn when</br>
    i was leaving my home. it was everywhere. it held an hatchet</br>
    behind the doorpost. on the bed it had piled a body draped</br>
    with a wolf's skin.</br>
    it looked like a peacock that was eying me dubiously</br>
    and getting ready to peck my hands. it lowered the blinds</br>
    on the windows. it was hiding so i couldn't see it.</br>
    i knew it was breathing down my neck</br>
    it tied up my breath and made things transparent</br>
    to which i had dedicated my vision.</br>
    it addressed me scornfully:</br>
    you who chew quartz you'll expect to vomit it</br>
    you'll learn to remember what you've forgotten</br>
    i am your knowledge that you waking predicted</br>
    that which you'll turn back to see will be darkness</br>
    the father who will never return</br>
    the sea off which flame will arrive</br>
    from which you'll go deaf.</br>
    who is stronger than war</br>
    i whom nobody asks about anything</br>
    an island from which only the name will remain</br>
    a usurer who'll loan to me</br>
    a weapon that kills before it's forged</br>
    or a snake that crawls in where it's no place for her.
