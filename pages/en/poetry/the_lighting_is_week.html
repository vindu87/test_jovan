<h4>THE LIGHTING IS WEAK</h4>
<p>

    if you exist oh creator</br>
    verb of turning.</br>
    but it has already been repeated countless times</br>
    that your yeast isn’t thrown into anything.</br>
    if you exist</br>
    therefore</br>
    uninvolved</br>
    considered</br>
    hard-skinned like a saint on an elevation</br>
    while he follows what will never and never</br>
    touch him</br>
    can any kind of creature start to tremble</br>
    remembering your heroisms.</br>
    for what is done to increase love</br>
    and who raised a pulley into the heights. but you where are you</br>
    whom descendents would address</br>
    at whom father and young would look</br>
    where is the rose from which eloquence flows</br>
    the mouth where is it that will once and for all</br>
    spit me out. therefore if you exist brick</br>
    from a firm door</br>
    say how the whole thing ran. he who is</br>
    truly a witness will know from which height</br>
    to testify.</br>
    or say: ladies and gentlemen. comrades</br>
    i can’t sing out that piece just like that</br>
    the lighting is weak</br>
    the music miserable</br>
    the pay barely enough to get by.
