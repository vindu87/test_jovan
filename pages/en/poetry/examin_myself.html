<h4>EXAMINE MYSELF</h4>
<p>

    is my hope in vain.</br>
    the motherly lap. a downpour</br>
    of flame above the table.</br>
    here where i picked up bread and</br>
    wine. under the crown of a walnut</br>
    compressing my tongue. is my</br>
    hope in vain. merry</br>
    words. a flock of gnats. clarity.</br>
    a hand moves the press. the sermonizer</br>
    speaks floating above the multitude.</br>
    have i memorized what i learned.</br>
    human language. the laws of nature.</br>
    i sit at the dinner table and examine myself.
