<h4>BEND</h4>
<p>

    before i understood what it was about</br>
    before i had advanced my own reasons</br>
    before i knew where i was headed</br>
    before i could know where i had left from</br>
    and where to start what i had started</br>
    before i had scented the diamond</br>
    tasted of deafness</br>
    sung in the desert</br>
    they advised me:</br>
    bend your head. hunch over.</br>
    but isn’t it bent enough</br>
    haven’t i done it so it’s visible.</br>
    bend it so it really shows</br>
    hunch so you cast a shadow on uprightness</br>
    hunch so that we rejoice in hunchedness</br>
    take it into your heart</br>
    pierce your soul with it</br>
    be master of your limbs</br>
    be inspired by hunchbackedness</br>
    shine like a disk that doesn’t fly</br>
    glow like bentness that can’t be repeated</br>
    that will lower unbentness</br>
    that will put a brake on its tongue</br>
    to sweep with its words</br>
    to shorten its height</br>
    muddy its visibility</br>
    to limit its width</br>
    hunch yourself for your own sake</br>
    for the sake of worldly fame</br>
    of salvation that’s within arm’s reach</br>
    continue so that we grasp hunchedness</br>
    so we understand the mercy with which we’re rewarded</br>
    so we are exalted by the strength that we’ve taken</br>
    so we are confirmed in the mind with which we’re mindful</br>
    so we depend on the bentness</br>
    that we gave to you.
