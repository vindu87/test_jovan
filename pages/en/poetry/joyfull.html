<h4>JOYFULLY BOUND TO THE EVENT</h4>
<p>

    on the foundations of this and that</br>
    the building should be continued.</br>
    let’s say a wall raised vertically</br>
    over the ground line.</br>
    not at all wastefully</br>
    gradually with dependability</br>
    brick upon brick</br>
    the mixture of cement of mortar</br>
    of language. stringing sweep</br>
    upon sweep</br>
    lifting the view to a higher height</br>
    under the line drawn by graphite</br>
    pencil. that’s a home.</br>
    i lie wrapped in a sheet: warmth</br>
    knowledge. as far as i’m concerned i can</br>
    go down. take a stroll. look over</br>
    life etc.</br>
    but the cube of sugar dissolves</br>
    and the water’s boiling.</br>
    joyfully bound to the event</br>
    i don’t move a muscle.
