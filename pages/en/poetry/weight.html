<h4>WEIGHT</h4>
<p>
    two and two make four</br>
    paltry knowledge but dependable</br>
    how much it was helpful</br>
    when i was counting</br>
    what the crack of dawn would make known</br>
    when i was guarding what needed to be lost.</br>
    the bill was the wilderness</br>
    while the water was peaceful</br>
    and a murmur flew into the heights</br>
    and a sparrow-hark sang in the wildness</br>
    but those who were passing only looked at me</br>
    as if at a weight that is yet to be laid</br>
    on the scales.</br>
    while i made haste to chew up what could be expounded</br>
    i waved as much as my heart knew how to calculate</br>
    i saw that water was mixing up the numbers</br>
    that the air was devouring the sums</br>
    that a clap of thunder threw out fragments and scattered them</br>
    in tails of light</br>
    that the roof was the place where works turn to stone</br>
    and the supports give way</br>
    so that the underground climbs with a hank of fire</br>
    and pours over the cities</br>
    that to leave doesn't also find</br>
    that to shore up doesn't mean to save</br>
    that to find doesn't mean to take on the deferred</br>
    to go away lacks the soul of return</br>
    that the one who returns has no memory</br>
    and that when three go away but one returns</br>
    it's as if no one returned.</br>
    i saw a shadow that grows in the dark</br>
    a treetop that looms over the trunk</br>
    a swallow that attacks an eagle</br>
    a hatchet that returns on the shoulder of an angel</br>
    however much you gather</br>
    however much you forget</br>
    will be too much.
