<h4>THE GANDER KING</h4>
<p>
    i was sitting on a green mound</br>
    above a pond. motionlessness of noon</br>
    and frozen outlines of geese. i threw a stone</br>
    into the water. it chose</br>
    its path by way of my hand. rings wavered</br>
    on the water</br>
    like the rings from other stories</br>
    different from themselves</br>
    fed in vanishing</br>
    by their spines.</br>
    and as if someone had flayed</br>
    the skin from their backs</br>
    so they turned</br>
    into a visage iâ€™d already seen</br>
    the visage of the gander king</br>
    who preaches eternity.
