<h4>THE GANDER KING</h4>
<p>
    i was sitting on a green mound
    above a pond. motionlessness of noon
    and frozen outlines of geese. i threw a stone
    into the water. it chose
    its path by way of my hand. rings wavered
    on the water
    like the rings from other stories
    different from themselves
    fed in vanishing
    by their spines.
    and as if someone had flayed
    the skin from their backs
    so they turned
    into a visage iâ€™d already seen
    the visage of the gander king
    who preaches eternity.
