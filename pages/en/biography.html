                <p>Stevka Shmitran in her PhD dissertation <i>On Jovan Zivlak’s Poetry: Singing Antiutopia in the
                        World
                        of History wrote:</i></p>
                <p>“In the core of this poetry there is a philosophical basis, lament of the modern subject of
                    subtle reflection about the
                    issues of the being. Zivlak’s language is spiritually and artistically sovereign in its
                    autoproblematiying, clearly and
                    strongly profilized, thought interrupted with pauses and breathing which fragmentize the meaning
                    of the forever lost
                    totality</p>
                <p>Even more clearly, his intellectuality in understanding contemporary culture, community,
                    literature, power, role of
                    individuals, individual truths, freedom, sense … is shown in his essay books. Zivlak’s spiritual
                    and philosophical
                    comprehension leads to complex morphology of the world, society and culture, to the
                    understanding of ambivalent role of
                    the man in relation to nature and his own culture and history…”
